# Recommendation-System---Books-
This project builds an end-to-end Book Recommendation System using users.csv, ratings.csv, and books.csv. Data is cleaned, merged, and analyzed using EDA. Collaborative filtering with Truncated SVD is applied to generate user-based and item-based recommendations, and the model is deployed using Streamlit.
